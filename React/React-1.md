# React Interview Questions

Q) What is React? Why is React known as `React`?
A: - React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications. 
- It allows developers to create reusable UI components, making the development process more modular and maintainable. 
- React follows a component-based architecture, where each component is self-contained and manages its own state.
- The name 'React' was chosen because the library is designed to enable developers to "react" to changes in application state and data.
- When the state or data changes, React efficiently updates and re-renders only the necessary components, ensuring a smooth and performant user experience. This process is made possible through React's use of the virtual DOM, which optimizes the updates made to the real DOM, allowing for efficient rendering.
- This combination of declarative UI building and efficient state management is why React is so widely used in modern web development.
