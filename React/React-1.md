# React Interview Questions

Q) What is React? Why is React known as `React`?
- React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications. 
- It allows developers to create reusable UI components, making the development process more modular and maintainable. 
- React follows a component-based architecture, where each component is self-contained and manages its own state.
- The name 'React' was chosen because the library is designed to enable developers to "react" to changes in application state and data.
- When the state or data changes, React efficiently updates and re-renders only the necessary components, ensuring a smooth and performant user experience. This process is made possible through React's use of the virtual DOM, which optimizes the updates made to the real DOM, allowing for efficient rendering.
- This combination of declarative UI building and efficient state management is why React is so widely used in modern web development.

Q) What is a Library?
- A library is a collection of pre-written code snippets that developers can use to perform common tasks, instead of writing the code from scratch. These snippets typically handle specific functions or features, and they can be integrated into application code to speed up the development process and reduce the chances of introducing errors.

In the case of a JavaScript library, you can "plug in" the library's code to your own project, enabling you to use pre-built functions and components. This helps in building applications more efficiently and with more reliability.

Examples of JavaScript libraries include:

React: A library for building user interfaces.
jQuery: A library that simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling.
Libraries allow developers to focus more on building the application's unique features instead of reinventing common functionality.
